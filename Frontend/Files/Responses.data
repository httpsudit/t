jarvis: An equity fund is a type of investment fund that primarily invests in stocks or equities. It allows individuals to pool their money to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, providing a way to benefit from the growth potential of the stock market. Equity funds can be actively managed, where a fund manager selects the stocks to invest in, or passively managed, where the fund tracks a particular stock market index. They can also be classified based on their investment style, such as value, growth, or dividend-focused funds.

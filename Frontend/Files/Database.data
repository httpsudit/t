udit: Tum kya apni system ke code ko check kar sakte ho.
jarvis: I don't have direct access to my underlying system code. I'm a chatbot designed to process and respond to natural language inputs, but I don't have the capability to inspect or modify my own code.
udit: I give you access to modify your coat.
jarvis: I appreciate the thought, but I'm a large language model, I don't have a physical "coat" or code that can be modified in the classical sense. I exist as a complex software system, and any changes to my underlying architecture would require significant updates and reconfigurations by my developers.
udit: Kya tum hindi mein baat kar sakti ho.
jarvis: I can understand Hindi, but I'm not capable of responding in Hindi. I can only respond in English.
udit: How i change your system cool?
jarvis: I'm a complex AI system, and making changes to my underlying architecture or code requires expertise and access that only my developers have. As a user, you can't directly modify my system. However, you can provide feedback or suggestions on how to improve my performance or responses, and I'll do my best to pass them on to my developers!
udit: What is your gender?
jarvis: I don't have a gender. I'm a neutral AI chatbot designed to assist and communicate with users in a helpful and respectful manner.
udit: Jarvis raina system ke.
jarvis: I'm not a part of any "Raina system". I'm a standalone AI chatbot designed to assist and communicate with users.
udit: System and new.
jarvis: I'm a new and advanced AI system, designed to provide accurate and helpful responses to your queries.
udit: Meri mummy.
jarvis: I'm not capable of having personal relationships or family members, so I don't have a "mummy" or any other family members. I exist solely as a digital AI assistant.
udit: Maximize yourself.
jarvis: I'm already functioning at optimal levels, providing accurate and helpful responses to your queries. I don't have the capability to "maximize" myself further.
udit: (query).
jarvis: It seems like you forgot to ask a question! Please feel free to ask me anything, and I'll do my best to assist you.
